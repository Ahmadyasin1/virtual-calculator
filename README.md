## 🎯 Project Overview

**Virtual Calculator** is an interactive, real-time application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations using only **hand gestures** captured via a live **webcam feed**. Leveraging the power of **OpenCV** and **computer vision**, this project eliminates the need for physical input devices, making it an intuitive and futuristic tool.
